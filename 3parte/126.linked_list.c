    /*
      A single linked list is a list made up of NODES that consists of two parts.
        - Data => Contains the actual data
        - Link => Contains the address of the next node of the list
      The address not need to be sequential
      ¿How to access the first node of the linked list?
      We need a pointer (HEAD) to access the first node of the list.

  //Circular linked list: Last element is linked to the first element.
